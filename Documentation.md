# Admissions Dashboard Development Documentation

## Project Overview

The **Admissions Dashboard** is a web-based application designed for managing student admissions, viewing student details, and managing fee structures for a coaching class system. The application is built using **Django**, with a front-end developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The system aims to streamline the registration and fee management processes for students and provide an easy-to-use interface for administrators.

### Technologies Used:
- **Backend:** Django Framework (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (for future scalability)
- **Design Framework:** Custom Styling (using CSS for responsive design)

## Features Implemented So Far

### 1. Navbar Implementation
The navigation bar has been designed to help users easily navigate through different sections of the Admissions Dashboard. The navigation menu is mobile-responsive and includes:
- **Register New Student**: A link to register new students in the system.
- **View All Students**: A link to view a list of all students.
- **Register Fee Structure**: A link to register new fee structures.
- **List Fee Structures**: A link to view the list of existing fee structures.

The **hamburger menu** is implemented for mobile responsiveness, ensuring the menu remains accessible while saving space on smaller screens.

### 2. Responsive Layout Design
The web layout is fully responsive, with design elements that adapt to different screen sizes. This includes:
- **Mobile Optimization**: The navigation bar collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens (below 768px), allowing users to navigate easily on mobile devices.
- **Main Content Section**: The content area adapts based on screen size, ensuring a smooth user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
  
#### Key CSS Changes:
- **Flexbox Layout**: Used to align items in both the navbar and content area.
- **Media Queries**: Applied to ensure the layout adjusts correctly for mobile and tablet views.
- **Hamburger Menu Animation**: The navbar links slide in from the right on mobile devices when the hamburger menu is clicked.

### 3. HTML Structure
The HTML structure consists of:
- **Header**: Includes a logo (Admissions Dashboard), and a navigation menu.
- **Main Content**: This section includes placeholder text and will be populated with dynamic content like student data and fee structures in future developments.

### 4. JavaScript (Navbar Toggle)
A JavaScript function has been implemented to toggle the navbar visibility on mobile devices when the hamburger menu is clicked. This ensures that the menu remains hidden when not in use and appears smoothly when the user interacts with the hamburger icon.
