# Admissions System Development Documentation

## Project Overview

The **Admissions System** is designed to facilitate the management of student admissions, fee structures, and related processes in an educational institution. This web-based solution is built using the **Django framework**, with an emphasis on a **responsive design** for seamless user experience across both desktop and mobile platforms.

The system allows administrators to:
- Register and manage student admissions.
- Define and manage fee structures for different classes and boards.
- Track payments and generate receipts.
- Navigate through the system via an intuitive dashboard and responsive navigation.

The platform is scalable and built with **PostgreSQL** for future-proofing and **custom CSS** for a mobile-first, responsive design.

### Technologies Used:
- **Backend:** Django Framework (Python)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (for future scalability)
- **Design Framework:** Custom Styling (using CSS for responsive design)

### Key Features:
- **Student Registration**: Secure and straightforward student enrollment process.
- **Fee Structure Management**: Ability to define and manage fee structures for multiple boards and classes.
- **Payment Tracking**: Ability to record and track payments, as well as generate printable receipts.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices, with a dynamic hamburger menu for mobile navigation.

## Features Implemented So Far

### 1. **User Registration and Login (04/05/25)**
Implemented user authentication using a username and password-based registration and login system to manage user access to the platform.

### 2. **Admission Dashboard (05/05/25)**
A centralized dashboard was created to enable admins to manage all aspects of the system efficiently:
- Register New Student
- Register New Fee Structure
- View All Students
- View Fee Structure

This dashboard is fully responsive, with a hamburger menu for easy navigation on mobile devices (08/05/2025).

### 3. **Register New Student (06/05/25)**
A form was developed to allow the registration of new students. This form captures personal details and enrollment information, such as class and board. The form is mobile-friendly and responsive across devices (08/05/2025).

### 4. **View All Students (06/05/25)**
Implemented a page that lists all registered students along with their fee payment details. It includes functionality for admins to view and process payments, as well as generate receipts that can be printed.

### 5. **Register New Fee & View Fee Structure**
Developed the ability to register new fee structures for different classes and boards. Admins can also view, edit, and delete fee structures as necessary.

### 6. **Navbar Implementation**
Designed and developed a responsive navigation bar, allowing admins to easily navigate the system. The navbar includes:
- Links to register new students.
- View all students.
- Register and list fee structures.
The mobile version of the navbar uses a hamburger menu for a compact design.

### 7. **Responsive Layout Design**
The system’s layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience across devices. The navbar becomes a hamburger menu on screens smaller than 768px, and the content area adjusts based on screen size.

#### Key CSS Features:
- **Flexbox Layout**: Utilized for alignment and responsiveness in the navbar and content sections.
- **Media Queries**: Applied for mobile and tablet optimization.
- **Hamburger Menu Animation**: A smooth animation allows the navigation links to slide in from the right on mobile devices.

### 8. **JavaScript (Navbar Toggle)**
A JavaScript function was implemented to toggle the visibility of the navbar on mobile devices when the hamburger menu is clicked, ensuring an intuitive user experience.
